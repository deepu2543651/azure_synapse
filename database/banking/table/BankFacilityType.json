The borrower may draw down and repay advances during the term of the credit facility. Amounts repaid can be re- borrowed. The borrower can o en select an interest period and fix the interest rate it pays over that period for each advance it draws. At the end of an interest period, the borrower will decide whether to repay or \"rollover\" the advance into a new interest period. Rolling over an advance means the advance remains outstanding as far as the borrower is concerned. Further advances can be drawn down at any time during the availability period (commonly almost as long as the term of the credit facility) with different interest periods running in parallel.",
