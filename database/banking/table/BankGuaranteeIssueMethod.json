This bank (usually a foreign bank with head office in the beneficiary's country of domicile) is requested by the initiating bank to issue a guarantee in return for the latter's counter-liability and counter-guarantee. In this case, the initiating bank will cover the guaranteeing (foreign) bank against the risk of any losses which it may incur in the event that a claim is made under the guarantee. It formally pledges to pay the amounts claimed under the guarantee upon first demand by the guaranteeing bank.",
