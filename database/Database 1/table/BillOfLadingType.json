		"Description": "A type of bill of lading.\n\nEx:\n- Container Bill Of Lading\n- Switch Bill Of Lading\n- Original Bill Of Lading\n- Inland Bill Of Lading\n- Charter Party Bill Of Lading\n- Multimodal/Combined Transport Bill Of Lading\n- Short Form Bill Of Lading\n- Ocean Bill Of Lading\n- Air Waybill\n- Blank Endorsed\n- Sea Waybill\n\nwhere:\nContainer Bill Of Lading: \nA bill of lading that  indicates that goods are carried in a container as one unit of cargo.\nThe container in which the goods are locked-in are generally numbered in a systematic manner indicating ownership, type of container, size of container and identification number. \nThis facilities quicker loading/unloading at the port and thus avoids congestion.\n\nSwitch Bill Of Lading:\nA Switch Bill of Lading is called \"the trader's second set\" and intended to replace the  first set of Bills of Lading issued. \nUsually used where a seller / trader wishes to keep the name of his supplier i.e. shipper, secret from ultimate buyer of the goods. Under this type of BL, only the name of the shipper and or consignee and or Notify Party can be changed. The normal BL has to be surrendered, but the BL number remains the same.\nThis type of BOL is commonly used during foreign-to-foreign shipments, where the shipper requires their suppliers information to be kept private. \nDuring this shipment, there will be two sets of bills \"switched\" to protect the suppliers information from the consignee and vice versa.\n\nInland Bill Of Lading:\nAn inland bill of lading is used for cargo shipments by rail or road, but not sea.\nAn inland bill of lading is often the first transportation document issued for an international shipment, and is used to transport goods over land via rail, road or inland waterway, to the point at which the exporter's international carrier can place it on a ship. \nIt is the contract between the owner of the goods and the carrier, stating in detail a description of the goods, their value, their origin and destination, and the terms of their transportation. It will state the particular vehicle the goods are to be transported on, and how freight charges are to be paid. The bill of lading serves as the receipt for the owner of the goods as well as the carrier's title for the purposes of transportation.\nBecause it is concerned with domestic overland transportation, the inland bill of lading will not be consigned directly to the foreign buyer of the goods but to a third party, who is usually the international carrier of the goods, but consignment to another third party (such as a warehouse, freight forwarder or packaging company) before it reaches the international carrier is possible. \nIf consigned to such a third party, that party will, in turn, need to consign it to the international carrier. If an inland bill of lading is non-negotiable, it may only be delivered to the named consignee, but if it is negotiable, then the carrier in possession of the bill of lading may re-route the shipment.\n\nCharter Party Bill Of Lading:\nA charter party bill of lading is a contract between the ship owners and the hirer who may hire the vessel on a voyage basis or duration basis.\nThe document containing the terms and conditions of this contract are known as the Charter Party. The shipper who has chartered the ship may agree to carry the goods of others in the ship and issue a BL for the purpose. Such BL is called Charter Party BL. This kind of BL is subject to the terms and conditions agreed upon by the hirer of the ships / ship space and ship owners. Generally, banks do not accept Charter Party BL as the ship owner may exercise lien over the goods in case charterers do not pay hire charges\n\nMultimodal/Combined Transport Bill Of Lading:\nThis type of BOL is exactly what it sounds like: a document issued for a shipment which is using more than one mode of transportation (i.e. ocean, air, land, etc.).\n\nShort Form Bill Of Lading:\nShort form Bills of Lading, also called Blank Back Bills of Lading, are bills of lading that do not include the terms and conditions of shipment on the back side of the bill. In some cases, these short form bills reference a separate document that includes terms and conditions which may or may not accompany the bill to the receiver.\n\nOcean Bill Of Lading:\nA bill of lading used for shipping goods overseas, which authorizes the holder or another party to take possession of the goods. Ocean bills of lading can be straight bills of lading or consigned \"to order\" bills of lading.\n\nAir Waybill:\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a document that accompanies goods shipped by an international air courier to provide detailed information about the shipment and allow it to be tracked. The bill has multiple copies so that each party involved in the shipment can document it. An air waybill (AWB), also known as an air consignment note, is a type of bill of lading. However, an AWB serves a similar function to ocean bills of lading, but an AWB is issued in non-negotiable form, meaning there's less protection with an AWB versus bills of lading.\nAn air waybill (AWB) serves as a receipt of goods by an airline (the carrier), as well as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier. It's a legal agreement that's enforceable by law. The AWB becomes an enforceable contract when the shipper (or shipper's agent) and carrier (or carrier's agent) both sign the document.\nThe airway bill will also contain the shipper's name and address, consignee's name and address, three-letter origin airport code, three letter destination airport code, declared shipment value for customs, number of pieces, gross weight, a description of the goods, and any special instructions.\nAWBs are unlike other bills of lading, in that they are non-negotiable instruments, meaning that it does not specify on which flight the shipment will be sent, or when it will reach its destination.\n\nBlank Endorsed:\nA bill of lading which has been endorsed but doesn't name an endorsee. Essentially, this means the holder of the BOL can claim possession of the goods, and as such this document is considered negotiable. \nA buyer/shipper who holds the original BOL can claim the goods from the carrier at destination as long as the holder submits at least one original copy of the BOL.\n\nSea Waybill:\nA carrier must, on demand, provide the shipper with a bill of lading; but if the shipper agrees, a lesser document such as a \"sea waybill\" may be issued instead. \nIn recent years, the use of bills of lading has declined, and they have tended to be replaced with the sea waybill.\nThe main difference between these two documents is that the waybill gives the bearer the right to possession of the cargo, but does not confer title in the goods. \nAs a result, there is no need for the physical document to be presented for the goods to be released. The carrier will automatically release the goods to the consignee once the import formalities have been completed. \nThis results in a much smoother flow of trade, and has allowed shipping lines to move towards electronic data interchange which may greatly ease the flow of global trade.",
