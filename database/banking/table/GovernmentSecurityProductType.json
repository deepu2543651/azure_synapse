		"Description": "A type of government security.\n\nEx:\n-  Government Bond\n-  Government Note\n-  Government Bill\n-  Treasury Bill\n-  Treasury Note\n-  Treasury Bond\n-  Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS)\n-  Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS)\n-  Cash Management Bill (CMB)\n\nwhere\nTREASURY BILL\nTreasury bills are book-entry, US government guaranteed debt obligations that mature in one year or less such as 13 weeks, 26 weeks or 52 weeks.   Treasury bills are not coupon-bearing and trade at a discount to face value.    Like other securities, individual issues of T-bills are identified with a unique CUSIP number.\n\nTreasury bills are sold by single price auctions held weekly.\n\nThe Treasury bill market is highly liquid; investors can quickly convert bills to cash through a broker or bank. \n\nTreasury bills function like zero-coupon bonds.   Investors buy bills at a discount from the par, or face, value and then receive the full amount when the bill matures. \n\nThe difference between the discounted price and face value represents the return to the investor.\n\n-  Settlement is next day, same day or delayed settlement.\n\n-  Bills are sold at a discount. The discount rate is determined at auction.\n\n-  Bills pay interest only at maturity. The interest is equal to the face value minus the purchase price.\n\n-  Bills are sold in increments of $100. The minimum purchase is $100.\n\n-  All bills except 52-week bills and cash management bills are auctioned every week. The 52-week bill is auctioned every four weeks. Cash management bills aren't auctioned on a regular schedule.\n\n-  Cash management bills are issued in variable terms, usually only a matter of days.\n\n-  Bills are issued in electronic form.\n\n-  You can hold a bill until it matures or sell it before it matures.\n\n-  In a single auction, an investor can buy up to $5 million in bills by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding.\n\nTREASURY NOTE\nTreasury notes are medium-term securities in denominations from $100 to $1,000,000.with a maturity period of 2,3,5,10 years with a coupon payment every six months.\n\nTreasury Notes are coupon-bearing, medium term debt obligations issued by the US Treasury.\n\nTreasury notes are issued in book-entry form.\n\nRegular settlement is next day, same day or delayed settlement.\n\n-  Issued in terms of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years\n\n-  Pays interest every six months until they mature\n\n-  When a note matures, you are paid its face value.\n\n-  The yield on a note is determined at auction.\n\n-  The price of a note may be greater than, less than, or equal to the face value of the note.  -  Sold in increments of $100. The minimum purchase is $100.\n\n-  Notes are issued in electronic form.\n\n-  You can hold a note until it matures or sell it before it matures. \n\n-  In a single auction, an investor can buy up to $5 million in notes by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding. \n\n-  Notes are sold in TreasuryDirect and Legacy Treasury Direct, and by banks, brokers, and dealers.\n\nTREASURY BOND\nTreasury bonds are long-term securities with a maturity period of 10 to 30 years.\n\nInterest is paid semi-annually. \n\nThe 30 year bond is callable after 25 years.\n\n-  When a Treasury bond matures, you are paid its face value.\n\n-  The yield on a bond is determined at auction.\n\n-  Bonds are sold in increments of $100. The minimum purchase is $100.\n\n-  You can hold a Treasury bond until it matures or sell it before it matures.\n\n-  In a single auction, an investor can buy up to $5 million in bonds by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding. \n\nTREASURY INFLATION-PROTECTED SECURITY (TIPS)\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) are the inflation-indexed bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. \n\nThese securities were first issued in 1997. The principal is adjusted to the Consumer Price Index, the commonly used measure of inflation. \n\nThe coupon rate is constant, but generates a different amount of interest when multiplied by the inflation-adjusted principal, thus protecting the holder against inflation. \n\n-  Regular settlement is next day, same day or delayed settlement.\n\n-  TIPS are issued in terms of 5, 10, and 20 years. The 20-year TIPS is no longer sold in Legacy Treasury Direct, but it continues to be available in TreasuryDirect.\n\n-  The interest rate on a TIPS is determined at auction.\n\n-  TIPS are sold in increments of $100. The minimum purchase is $100.\n\n-  TIPS are issued in electronic form.\n\n-  You can hold a TIPS until it matures or sell it in the secondary market before it matures.\n\n-  In a single auction, an investor can buy up to $5 million in TIPS by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding.\n\nSEPARATE TRADING OF REGISTERED INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL OF SECURITIES (STRIPS)\nSTRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) are debt securities created through the process of coupon stripping. They are Treasury bonds, except that the bond's principal has been separated (\"stripped\") from its interest or coupon.. Investors may choose to purchase securities based on either the principal or interest of the bond. \n\nSTRIPS are in form of zero-coupon securities.  They make no periodic interest payments like bonds.  STRIPS are purchased at a deep discount from their face value, which is the amount you receive when they mature.  Investors know exactly how much they will earn from their STRIPS investments. \n\nBrokerage firms purchase Treasury securities through the means of book-entry receipts in which  the Treasury records the firm's ownership of the bonds or notes.   However the firm does not actually hold.   The firm then strips the principal from the interest and creates zero-coupon securities based on portions, or units, of the principal or interest of the security.\n\nThe STRIP will always pay its face value at maturity which makes your return the difference between the face value and the discounted price you paid for it\n\nAnother advantage of STRIPS over the Treasury securities they are based on is the variety of maturity dates available.   Since STRIPS can be based on interest payments, there is no need to wait decades for maturity, and you can choose from a range of maturity dates that will offer differing returns. \n\nThere is an active secondary market for STRIPS.  STRIPS are eligible for inclusion in tax-deferred retirement plans, in which their value would grow tax-free until your retirement. \n\n-  interest earned on STRIPS must be reported in the year in which it is earned.\n\n-  Inflation adjustments to principal on TIPS must also be reported in the year earned.\n\n-  Income must be reported even though it is not received until maturity or the STRIPS are sold.\n\nCASH MANAGEMENT BILL (CMB)\nDuring periods when Treasury cash balances are particularly low, the Treasury may sell cash management bills (or CMBs). \n\nThese are sold at a discount and by auction just like weekly Treasury bills. They differ in that they are irregular in amount, term (often less than 21 days), and day of the week for auction, issuance, and maturity. \n\nWhen CMBs mature on the same day as a regular weekly bill, usually Thursday, they are said to be on-cycle. The CMB is considered another reopening of the bill and has the same CUSIP. \n\nWhen CMBs mature on any other day, they are off-cycle and have a different CUSIP number.",
