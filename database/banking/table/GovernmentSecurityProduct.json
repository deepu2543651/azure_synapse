		"Description": "A government security such as a bond, note or bill.\n\nTreasury securities are government bonds and debt financing instruments of the US Federal government that are issued by the US Department of the Treasury through the Bureau of the Public Debt.   They are sold in order to pay off maturing debt and raise the cash needed to run the federal government.\n\nThere are several types of non-marketable treasury securities including State and Local Government Series (SLGS), Government Account Series debt issued to government-managed trust funds, and savings bonds. All of the marketable Treasury securities are very liquid and are heavily traded on the secondary market.\n\nThere are six types of common marketable treasury securities:\n  - Treasury Bill\n  - Treasury Note\n  - Treasury Bond\n  - Treasury Inflation-Protected Security TIPS\n  - Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS)\n  - Cash Management Bill (CMB)\n\nAlthough Treasuries are considered free from credit risk, they are affected by other types of risk, principally interest-rate risk and inflation risk. \n\nWhile investors are effectively guaranteed to receive interest and principal as promised, the underlying value of the bond itself may change depending on the direction of interest rates.\n\nAs with all fixed-income securities, if interest rates in general rise after a Treasury security is issued, the value of the issued security will fall, since bonds paying higher rates will come into the market. \n\nSimilarly, if interest rates fall, the value of the older, higher-paying bond will rise in comparison with new issues.\n\nThe primary advantage of Treasury securities is safety. No other investment carries as strong a guarantee that interest and principal will be paid on time. Because these payments are predictable, many people invest in them to preserve and increase their capital and to receive a dependable income stream -- to help meet living expenses during retirement, for example, or to fund specific objectives, such as paying for a college education.\n\nThe benefit of predictability is enhanced by the fact that Treasuries generally do not have \"call\" provision. In fact, the Treasury has not issued \"callable\" securities since 1985. Call provisions, common in municipal and corporate bonds, permit the issuer to pay off the bond in full before its scheduled maturity. \n\nThis is especially likely to happen when interest rates decline; the issuer will refinance its debt to obtain the lower prevailing interest rate, just as home owners refinance mortgages. When that happens, the investor would be forced to pay more to earn the same interest rate. \n\nIf you own Treasuries that have no call provisions, you know exactly how long your income stream will last.\n\nAnother advantage of Treasuries is that they are available with a wide range of maturity dates. This allows an investor to structure a portfolio to specific time horizons.\n\nBecause they are the safest investments available, Treasury securities pay somewhat lower interest rates than other taxable fixed-income investments. Many investors accept this as a trade-off for security. In a diversified portfolio, Treasury securities usually represent money that investors want to keep safe from risk.\n\nAn added benefit of Treasury securities is that their interest payments are exempt from state and local income taxes (but not federal taxes). This has the effect of increasing the after-tax benefits of these investments. Investors in high-tax states should take special note of this benefit.\n\nAnother important characteristic of the Treasury market is its high level of liquidity, which means that Treasuries are easy to buy and sell. Because they trade so frequently in large volume, the spreads between what a dealer would be willing to pay and what a dealer would be willing to sell for is lower than for other securities.\n\nA short-term maturity (up to one year) discounted government security that is sold via competitive bidding at weekly or monthly government auctions in denominations from $10,000 to $1,000,000.    \n\nThe US Treasury invites all interested parties to submit bids, called a tender, then awards units to the highest bidders going down the list.\n\nThree and six-month bills are auctioned weekly.\nNine-month and one-year bills are auctioned monthly.\n\nThe high degree of safety and liquidity make treasury bills popular investments.",
